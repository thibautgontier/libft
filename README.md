# libft

This project is the first project of the 42 cursus. The aim is for us to build our own standard C library with all the functions that we may need throughout 
our C cursus, so that we understand in depth how these everyday functions work.

The library can be created using make, and can then be included in other C projects by linking it upon compilation.
